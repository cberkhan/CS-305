Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that develops individualized plans for their customers, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company wants to modernize their operations, protect their organization from external threats, and utilize the most current and effective software security. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I was able to provide a resolution to the vulnerabilties after identifying them and I was able to identify false positives and suppress them. It is extremely important to code securely to ensure unauthorized access to information or the software is as limited as possible. A company's wellbeing depends on the software they are utilizing to be safe and secure for their company and customers.  

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I found it both challenging and hlepful to have to manually review the code and identify any errors I had found. I do not think I have been asked to do that before; therefore, it was very interesting having to
review a code for issues that I did not write. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by introducing an encryption algorithm. I also ran tests to ensure the encryption algorithm was properly implemented into the code. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I verified that I did not introduce new vulnerabilites and the code was functional and secure by testing the encryption algorithm and by running a maven dependency check.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I really enjoyed utilizing maven to check the code for security vulnerabilties. I believe it is a very useful tool to identify any security risks in a code. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would should future employeers how I identified and provided a solution to an encryption algorithm cypher that I believe would best fit their needs. I was able to understand the 
needs of the client and determine which algorithm will best meet those needs.
